## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) approach to control a UAV on a coverage path planning including global-local map processing. The corresponding paper where DDQN is implemented ["UAV Path Planning using Global and Local Map Information with Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9659413) is available on IEEEXplore. This repo also contains the files for data harvesting for IOT devices but it's not implemented using PPO. This project uses the custom environment created by the sources mentioned in the above link. The implementation of the PPO algorithm is to test how the PPO algorithm performs in the environment which is tested by the DDQN algorithm. The original paper of this project can be found here. ([Link to the paper](https://github.com/bipinj08/Papers.git))


## Requirements
The requirement.txt file is created inside the repository which can be used to create the environment for this project.

## How to use

Train a new PPO model with the parameters of your choice in the specified config file for Coverage Path Planning (CPP):

```
python main.py --cpp --gpu --config config/manhattan32_cpp.json --id manhattan32_cpp


--cpp                  Activates CPP
--gpu                       Activates GPU acceleration for PPO training
--config                    Path to config file in json format
--id                        Overrides standard name for logfiles and model
--generate_config           Enable only to write default config from default values in the code
```

Evaluate a model through Monte Carlo analysis over the random parameter space for the performance indicators 'Successful Landing', 'Collection Ratio', 'Collection Ratio and Landed' as defined in the paper (plus 'Boundary Counter' counting safety controller activations), e.g. for 1000 Monte Carlo iterations:


For an example run of pretrained agents the following commands can be used:
```
python main_scenario.py --cpp --config config/manhattan32_cpp.json --weights example/models/manhattan32_cpp --scenario example/scenarios/manhattan_cpp.json --video
python main_scenario.py --cpp --config config/urban50_cpp.json --weights example/models/urban50_cpp --scenario example/scenarios/urban_cpp.json --video

```

## Resources

The city environments from the paper 'manhattan32' and 'urban50' are included in the 'res' directory. Map information is formatted as PNG files with one pixel representing on grid world cell. The pixel color determines the type of cell according to

* red #ff0000 no-fly zone (NFZ)
* blue #0000ff start and landing zone
* yellow #ffff00 buildings blocking wireless links (also obstacles for flying)

If you would like to create a new map, you can use any tool to design a PNG with the same pixel dimensions as the desired map and the above color codes.

The shadowing maps, defining for each position and each IoT device whether there is a line-of-sight (LoS) or non-line-of-sight (NLoS) connection, are computed automatically the first time a new map is used for training and then saved to the 'res' directory as an NPY file. The shadowing maps are further used to determine which cells the field of view of the camera in a CPP scenario.
